# PDF Scrapping
PDF scraping, also known as PDF data extraction or PDF parsing, involves extracting information and data from PDF documents. Python provides various libraries and tools to accomplish this task, one of which is PdfReader.
PdfReader is a powerful library in Python that allows you to read and extract data from PDF files. It is part of the PyPDF2 package and provides a simple and intuitive way to access the contents of a PDF document.
To begin PDF scraping using PdfReader, you first need to install the PyPDF2 library. You can install it using pip, the package installer for Python. Once installed, you can import the PdfReader class from the PyPDF2 module into your Python script.
To extract data from a PDF document, you start by opening the PDF file using the PdfReader object. You can do this by specifying the path to the PDF file as a parameter when creating an instance of PdfReader. Once the PDF file is open, you can access its contents, such as pages, text, images, and metadata. PdfReader provides various methods and attributes to access different elements of the PDF document. For example, you can use the getNumPages() method to get the total number of pages in the PDF. You can then iterate over the pages using a loop and extract text or other elements from each page using methods like getPage() and extractText().

PDF scraping using PdfReader in Python provides a convenient way to extract data from PDF documents and can be applied in various use cases such as data analysis, text mining, information retrieval, and more.
